            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Your Petitioner made his Address to his Grace the Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and after that, Petitioned his Majesty, who most Graciously was pleased to grant an Order to the said Bishop of <hi>Exceter</hi> to assist your Petitioner, whereupon he made a Report to his Majesty, with submission to his Majesty: And before his Majesty declares his pleasure, the said <hi>Opy</hi> surrenders his first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, and obtains a second, upon which the Lord Bishop immediately Institutes him.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioner Appeals to his Majesty and Councel, and upon that it was referred to his Grace the Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to examine, and being heard by Learned Councel on both sides it was adjudged that the Church was not at all full of the supposed incumbent, being an Infant and so uncapable: then a Title started up under pretence of a Lapse to his Majesty &amp; your Petitioner obtains a presentation from his Majesty, under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ends it to the Lord Bishop, who after twenty eight days time of consideration, was pressed for Institution, and the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> did think fit upon his Majesties, and the Lords of his Councels Reference, to write to the Lord Bishop of <hi>Exceter</hi> to give your Petitioner Institution or shew cause, yet your Petitioner was delayed, tot the end the said <hi>Opy</hi> might become of Age, and so the said <hi>Opy</hi> obtained the King's Presentation <hi>ad coroborandum,</hi> upon which he had Institution and Induction, and your Petitioner af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter five years trouble and expences; notwithstanding, his just Title in Law, laid aside.</p>
            <p>And for that the supposed Incumbent is still uncapable, being Unlicenced, and not Ordained as the Act of Uniformity of the 14<seg rend="sup">th.</seg> year of his Majesties Reign, and for that your Petitioner is left naked, and not relievable by Law or Equity, but by this Honourable House.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Petitioner Humbly prays the Honourable House to take the Premises into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to your wonted Justice in such cases, and your Petitioner shall submit to such order as the Honourable House shall think fit.</hi>
